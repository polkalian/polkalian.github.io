<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm a fourth-grade PhD student at the Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Xi'an Jiaotong University (西安交通大学人机所), and advised by Professor Yuehu Liu (刘跃虎). I'm also advised by Shuqiang Jiang (蒋树强) and collaborate with Xinhang Song (宋新航) and Sixian Zhang (张思贤) closely at the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Science (中科院计算所). I graduated from the Hsue-Shen Tsien Class, Xi'an Jiaotong University (西安交大钱学森班) with a bachelor's degree.

I'm an intern at PCG QQ, Tencent in Beijing, and engaged in research on multimodal foundation models, which includes LLM tool learning and multimodal content production.

My research interests include AI Agent, Embodied AI, and Large Language Models. I have published 9 papers at the top international AI conferences (including 5 CCF-A papers) and 
honorably served as a reviewer at multiple top conferences including Neurips, ICLR, TIP, etc.
